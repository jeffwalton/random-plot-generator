# This is a script to generate random sample plot locations for the UFORE model.

# To use this script you must have R installed on your computer.
#   You can download R from the main project website http://r-project.org by:
#   1) clicking on the CRAN link under download, 
#   2) selecting a mirror geographically near you,
#   3) selecting the operating system of your computer,
#   4) following the link for the 'base' package, and 
#   5) selecting 'Setup Program' and save onto your computer.
#   Execute the setup program on your computer to install.

#   Two packages must be installed: 'sp' and 'maptools'.
#   To install packages (on Windows),
#               1) From the menu bar, select 'Packages | Install Package(s)...', 
#               2) select a nearby mirror, and
#               3) select the 'maptools' and 'sp' packages.

# A GIS shapefile of your project boundary is also required.


# NOTE: Use the forward slash '/' in the file names.
# modify ONLY the following THREE lines:
boundaryFileName = "C:/JeffW/myUFOREproject/syrbnd_utm18.shp"          # the shapefile for your project boundary
randomPointsFileName = "C:/JeffW/myUFOREproject/UFORE_samplePoints"    # the output shapefile for the random points. NOTE: leave off the .shp extension.
numberOfPlots = 200                                                    # the approximate number of UFORE plots to create

getinfo.shape(boundaryFileName)

boundaryPolygon <- readShapePoly(boundaryFileName)

# This should give the area of the boundary polygon if it consists of one polygon.
boundaryPolygon@polygons[[1]]@area

# make a plot of the project boundary
plot(boundaryPolygon, border="blue", axes=TRUE, las=1)

# generate random points
randomSamplePoints <- spsample( boundaryPolygon, n=numberOfPlots, type="stratified")
# the "stratified" type is BD Ripley's notation and generates "randomized grid" points in UFORE jargon

# add the points to the plot
points( randomSamplePoints, pch=1, cex=.5)

# print summary information about the points
summary(randomSamplePoints)
# print the structure of the point data.frame
