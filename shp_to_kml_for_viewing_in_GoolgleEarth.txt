# This is the command to generate a kml file from the point or polygon shapeFile.
# The kml can then be viewed in Google Earth.
#
#
# This command is from the open source OGR library http://www.gdal.org/ogr/
# OGR utility programs are available on Debian-based Linux distributions
#   through the 'gdal-bin' package.
# On Windows, use the FWTools kit (http://fwtools.maptools.org/), which will
#   install the OGR utility programs. Run this command in the 'FWTools Shell'.
#
# Execute at the FWTools (or Linux) command line:  

ogr2ogr -f "KML" output.kml input.shp -dsco NameField=Id -t_srs "EPSG:4326"

# 
# input.shp is your point or polygon shapeFile
# output.kml is the resulting kml file to be displayed in GE
# -dsco NameField=Id will set the displayed name label to the Id number of the plot
# -t_srs "EPSG:4326" reprojects the output into the WGS84 Geographic system used by GE
